# Census_Income
## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project focuses on predicting income levels (<=50K or >50K) based on census data using various machine learning algorithms. The dataset contains demographic and employment-related features, and the goal is to build a model that accurately classifies individuals into income brackets.

## Project Structure
### Data Exploration: 
Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand feature distributions and relationships.

### Data Preprocessing:
Handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, and scaled numerical features.

### Model Training: 
Implemented and evaluated multiple classifiers:

Logistic Regression

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Gradient Boosting

Random Forest

### Model Evaluation: 
Compared performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.

### Prediction: 
Created a pipeline to make predictions on new data.

## Results
The Gradient Boosting classifier achieved the highest accuracy of 87.4%. Key findings:

Education level strongly correlates with income

Age shows a clear relationship with income potential

Models perform well at identifying lower incomes but have more difficulty with higher incomes
